I have always been interested in data structures, and how humans parse information. If you give 5 people the same task, and ask them to organize and execute it in the way that feels most natural to them, they'll all approach it differently.

I guess I'm more of a visual learner, and find it helpful to see how you get from point A to point B represented graphically, but I also love spreadsheets and organizing information in a way that is most efficient to me.

I've taken that approach in most of my working life, working as both an editor and designer, and striving for clean efficiency.

I taught myself HTML and CSS for fun, and used it as my job as a web manager. But I always wanted to delve deeper into how to make websites more dynamic, while simultaneously delivering information in the clearest and simplest way. Not to mention I want them to be cute and friendly!

The exposure I had to Ruby on Rails while managing that website only made me wish I knew more, and could create something with that knowledge. I tried teaching myself, but I needed more guidance and structure.

And here we are.
