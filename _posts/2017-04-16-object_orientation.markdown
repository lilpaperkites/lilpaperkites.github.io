Object Oriented Ruby features a class data structure. Classes are defined by the properties of the objects they contain, and use inheritance to share traits between classes and superclasses. Like Procedural Ruby, Object Oriented Ruby uses variables, but the variables can belong to the class or an object within that class.

A benefit is that one can create a new object that inhabits some of the class properties already defined, without having to redefine the class to make any changes or additions to an object.

Object Oriented Ruby also uses modules. Modules are defined variable actions that can be used in other classes with the mixin "include." Mixin modules can be defined outside of a class, and used within multiple classes.

There are also hashes, which are associative arrays. Instead of using just integers as array indeces, hashes allow all objects as index values. Hashes can then be used by classes to access or alter data that was stored in the hash.

Object Oriented Ruby is more dynamic than Prodecural Ruby, because of the behaviors that can be stored both within and without classes that enable more complex programs.
