Now we reach the blog topic that extends, unfortunately, beyond my coding knowledge and progress within the curriculum. Fortunately, the Internet exists. So, with that in mind, let's talk about Props. And maybe, have a little fun?


Key Concepts

Props are properties of a webpage. They are tags that, as a component of the React JavaScript code, use JS to create page properties that display text in a particular way on a webpage, such as color, size, much like with CSS tags, or as a way to link to existing data elsewhere.


Functions

Props pass data from parent to child, by using a heirarchical structure to inform function (or change it). When page elements are nested or subject to reuse, props come in handy for assigning attributes to those elements.


Best practices

Consider using props with dynamic data. States, another ReactJS component, are best used for static data. Nested within html tags inside of curly braces, the props are usually linked by dots ({this.props}), and written in camelCase.


OK, maybe not super fun, but I hope informative! Learning, at least, is fun.
